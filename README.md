# Kahoot Hack App

### **Disclaimer:** This only works for public Kahoots.

### About
It's an app that allows you to extract quiz ID from image containing the quiz ID in URL so you don't have to manually retype it like other apps and sites require you to do. There is also a history of previous Kahoots you scanned so you can check anytime and perhaps learn from it :)

### Usage
1. Open the app
2. Click **SELECT IMAGE** button and select image containing the URL with the quiz ID
3. If a text box with the quiz ID showed up, it means that the quiz ID was detected incorrectly. Compare the detected quiz ID with the one on the image and correct it. (usually characters like o/0 or l/i/f are wrong)
4. You should see all the questions and answers for the Kahoot! Happy cheating :)

### Build
1. Download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
2. Clone this repo to your machine
3. Open the cloned repo in the **Android Studio**
4. In the toolbar select **Build** and then **Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)** and select **Build APK**
5. A popup in the bottom right corner should appear there click **locate** and file explorer should open in the location of the **apk named app_debug.apk**
